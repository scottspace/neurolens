Source code for AI avatar "neurolens" experiment

  - Replicate.com hosted on GCP
  - APIs for training Flux LoRA layers
  - APIs for driving Flux 1.1 + LoRA image generation
  - Private GCS for storing images
  - Orchestration via Flask
  - Flask, TailWind, jQuery on App Engine with https load balancer
  - OAuth 2.0 using custom browser storage and custom Firestore session state

We first thought it would be a good idea to just have people
sign up with a google cloud account, then upload their images
to a GCS bucket.  Interestingly, this proved far too difficult
for business customers and friends, as a new account requires
a new IAM configuration, service account configuration, OAuth
configuration, and session state (Chrome wasn't supporting cookies
by default in many instances).

What we thought would be a quick hookup to Replicate, as you can hear
on the Lex Fridman podcast with @levelsio, turned out to to be a multi-week
struggle with OAuth on AppEngine, getting session state correct, so that
sessions could be shared across multiple, running container instances of
AppEngine.

We ended up storing MD5 summmarized session state flags in browser
storage, which would then refer to a state vector in a Firestore
JSON database that was accessed by each AppEngine node.  We then
had to adjust appengine and the Flask as the standard libraries
were not working and assumed a single server instance.  Further,
we then had to modify OAuth that also assumed the same server was
used during a basic authentication interaction, which wanted to
use cookies, which Chrome had disabled.

That was the long pole in the tent, about ten days or so.  Once
that was running, the engine came together quickly.  Gemini was
super useful with Tailwind, that has a litany of obscure tags
that while useful, present a steep learning curve.
